See [SEARCH_CONFIG_GUIDE.md](SEARCH_CONFIG_GUIDE.md) for detailed instructions.

Quick example - add a new profile to `search-config.json`:

```json
{
  "activeProfile": "your-custom-profile",
  "profiles": {
    "your-custom-profile": {
      "name": "Your Target Market",
      "description": "Description of who you're targeting",
      "leadCount": 50,
      "search": {
        "query": "Natural language description of your ideal leads",
        "criteria": [
          "role: specific job titles or roles",
          "works on: specific technologies or products",
          "company size: employee range",
          "needs: pain points they likely have"
        ],
        "enrichments": ["linkedin", "email", "twitter", "company", "github"]
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Adjust Number of Leads

In [search-config.json](search-config.json), change `leadCount`:
```json
{
  "profiles": {
    "default": {
      "leadCount": 100,  // Increase from 50 to 100
      ...
    }
  }
